# brews:
#   - # Name template of the recipe
#     # Default to project name
#     name: kess

#     # IDs of the archives to use.
#     # Defaults to all.
#     # ids:
#     #   - foo
#     #   - bar

#     # GOARM to specify which 32-bit arm version to use if there are multiple versions
#     # from the build section. Brew formulas support atm only one 32-bit version.
#     # Default is 6 for all artifacts or each id if there a multiple versions.
#     # goarm: 6

#     # NOTE: make sure the url_template, the token and given repo (github or gitlab) owner and name are from the
#     # same kind. We will probably unify this in the next major version like it is done with scoop.

#     # Github repository to push the tap to.
#     github:
#       owner: yamajik
#       name: homebrew-tap

#     # OR Gitlab
#     # gitlab:
#     #   owner: gitlab-user
#     #   name: homebrew-tap

#     # Gitea is not supported yet, but the support coming

#     # Template for the url which is determined by the given Token (github or gitlab)
#     # Default for github is "https://github.com/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/releases/download/{{ .Tag }}/{{ .ArtifactName }}"
#     # Default for gitlab is "https://gitlab.com/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/uploads/{{ .ArtifactUploadHash }}/{{ .ArtifactName }}"
#     url_template: "http://github.com/yamajik/suanpan-rocket/releases/download/{{ .Tag }}/{{ .ArtifactName }}"

#     # Allows you to set a custom download strategy. Note that you'll need
#     # to implement the strategy and add it to your tap repository.
#     # Example: http://lessthanhero.io/post/homebrew-with-private-repo-releases/
#     # Default is empty.
#     # download_strategy: GitHubPrivateRepositoryReleaseDownloadStrategy

#     # Allows you to add a custom require_relative at the top of the formula template
#     # Default is empty

#     # Setting this will prevent goreleaser to actually try to commit the updated
#     # formula - instead, the formula file will be stored on the dist folder only,
#     # leaving the responsibility of publishing it to the user.
#     # If set to auto, the release will not be uploaded to the homebrew tap
#     # in case there is an indicator for prerelease in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
#     # Default is false.
#     # skip_upload: true

#     # Custom block for brew.
